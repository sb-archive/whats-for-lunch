What's For Lunch at Springbot?
==============================

We at Springbot don't know where to eat lunch. Please build a program in the
modern language (Ruby, Python, JavaScript) of your choice that will help tell
us where we should eat. Ruby is preferred.

Please feel free to use any tools avaiable to you for solving this problem
with the exception of looking up an answer on the internet. This program does
not require a UI and can be implemented as a command line tool. Whatever choices
you make in implementation, please provide a README file on how to operate your
program.


## Requirements
* A README explaining how to run your program.
* A means for adding new springbots and restaurants to a database.
  We have provided seeds files for your convenience of testing. Feel free to add
  or remove more examples or other fields to either collection to help improve your
  algorithm. You may also add any additional collections you deem necessary. For
  example, you may want a ratings table so each user can rate a restaurant.
* There should be a means for marking a restaurant as visited today.
* We want a command that will tell us what restaurant we should go to today. Here
  are a few rules for your algorithm:
  * We should not be told to go to a restaurant two days in a row unless there is
    only one restaurant in the system.
  * Your algorithm should use recency and rating. Other factors are up to you.

### Extra Stuff:
* A user interface for doing all the operations. Please don't spend too much time on
  this if at all. We're really interested in your data handling and processing.

### Evaluation
We will be checking your program for the following:
* Functionality
* Code Readability
* Tests

Please be ready to discuss your program and all decisions made when you come in next.
